### Libramex

A web-based library management system (LMS) for educational institutions.  
Being developed as part of a university assignment with 2 other skilled coursemates.

### Vezel

An AI chatbot solely focused on transport in biology, another university assignment.  
Working on it with the same 2 coursemates!

### Apudis

A Discord bot I'm developing to make use of my university's app API, providing quality of life features like exam result updates. <sup>*honestly i should make PRs on their app instead of hacking together my own solutions*</sup>

### rocessorise

Another Discord bot! This one uses Canvas to generate customised virtual clothing for Roblox characters.
