Hey there, I'm **Tan Jun Yan**, but I usually go by **Yan**!  
I'm a Malaysian guy currently pursuing a diploma in ICT and software engineering at Asia Pacific University (APU).  

## Current Projects

### Libramex

A web-based library management system (LMS) for educational institutions.  
Being developed as part of a university assignment with 2 other skilled coursemates.

### Vezel

An AI chatbot solely focused on transport in biology, another university assignment.  
Working on it with the same 2 coursemates!

### Apudis

Discord bot written in Node.JS. Originally used to notify me of any exam result updates (because I was pretty impatient), planning on implementing more features using APU's REST API.

### rocessorise

Another Node.JS Discord bot! This one uses Canvas to generate customised virtual clothing for Roblox characters.

## Job availability

I'm currently looking for an internship opportunity in Malaysia!  
Preferably in IT/SWE, but I'm also open to design, social media management, etc.  
Available for an 8 week term, from 2021-04-05 to 2021-05-28 (that's in ISO 8601!)

## Contact

I can be reached at any time through my email, yan@yan3321.com.
