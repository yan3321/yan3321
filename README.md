Hey there, I'm **Tan Jun Yan**, but I usually go by **Yan**!  
I'm a Malaysian guy currently pursuing a diploma in ICT and software engineering at Asia Pacific University (APU).  

## Current Projects

![currentProjects](./img/CurrentProjects_128.png)

### Libramex

A web-based library management system (LMS) for educational institutions. Written in HTML/CSS/JS and PHP. 
Being developed as part of a university assignment with 2 other skilled coursemates.

### Vezel

An AI chatbot solely focused on transport in biology, another university assignment.  
Working on it with the same 2 coursemates!

### Apudis

Discord bot written in Node.JS. Originally used to notify me of any exam result updates (because I was pretty impatient), planning on implementing more features using APU's REST API.

### rocessorise

Another Node.JS Discord bot! This one uses Canvas to generate customised virtual clothing for Roblox characters.

## Job availability

I'm currently employed full-time as a software developer, but I'm happy to discuss any work that does not pose a conflict of interest with my current employer(s). Let's get in touch!

## Contact

I can be reached at any time through my email, yan@yan3321.com.
