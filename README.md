### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About
Hey there, I'm Tan Jun Yan, but I usually go by Yan! I'm a Malaysian currently studying IT and software engineering.  
Even though my focus is around code and tech, I actually consider myself extremely versatile, a "jack of all trades" if you wish.  
I've dabbled in graphic design, video editing, 3D art, social media management, and a lot more!  
If you're in need of a Swiss army knife in the shape of a human, you've come to the right place.

# Job availability
I'm currently looking for an internship opportunity in tech in 2021.  
Let me know if you're interested! I am very excited to offer my vast skillset to your business.

Feel free to reach me via my email, yan@yan3321.com.
